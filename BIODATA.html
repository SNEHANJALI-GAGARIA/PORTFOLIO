         <p style="text-align: justify,center;"><p font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;>My hobbies are listening songs and painting.
            My strenghts are my parents.They always motivate me to try new things and learn from my mistakes.
            I aspire to become a Research Scientists.
            With speaking less I would like to state the reason why would Ecell technical team induct me:
              Recently,I have completed a google digital garage's Fundamentals of digital marketing course.
              So,while making projects I will make them by keeping in mind what I have learned through that course.
              Also,I have learned Python during my +2 classes.I would be greatful to be a part of this amazing Ecell family.
              I would like to conclude by saying that I am the very happiest person in the world who loves to spread only
              postivity and a colourful environment to the people around me.<b>THANK YOU...</b></p></p>
